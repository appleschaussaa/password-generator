## Overview
​
### The challenge
​
Users should be able to:
​
- Create variables for reference in the code later and throughout
- create functions with said variables
- introduce loops to get the preffered outcome

## My process
​
### Built with
​
- Javascript
​
### What I learned
​
To be honest just about everything in this project was something that was learned or relearned. The loops are something that is still an ongoing process though
​
### Continued development
​
I've gotten approved to start seeing a tutor to get a better understanding of Javascript primarily on building from scratch. I am able to look into the code and understand fairly well what it does but building from scratch is a different story. My saving grace was finding clips that could help move the building of the code along like declaring variables insde functions was the first big hurdle. Will definitely come back to this after meeting with the tutor.

### Useful resources
​
- [Resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) - very in depth for looking into every aspect of Javascript
- [Resource 2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/while) - Helped with learning about while loops as that seems to be the preferred loop type
- [Resource 3](https://stackoverflow.com/) - seems like when researching solutions, stackoverflow showed up and gave insight on how to write 
- [Resource 4](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_while.asp) - shows that if statements can coincide with while statements
- [Resource 5](https://betterprogramming.pub/stop-putting-so-many-if-statements-in-your-javascript-3b65aaa4b86b) - shows how to make a clean if statement within a function, tried to make a look up map work but could not
- [Resource 6](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/random-string-generator-using-javascript/) - helps get an idea on randomizing but put into the script.js instead of HTML so cant use it exactly how it is

## Acknowledgments

There were a good amount of support that helped me get this far on the project. The instructer and TAs have been a huge help in class and office hours. All the online resources and forums discussing problems and ideas on how to fix were nice to stumble upon. The roadmap in the modules gave an almost endless amount of topics to read through. Also my sister-in-law is in the field and was able to offer some help and resources that could offer guidance.
